# Free Web Page Hosting

So I’m doing a short post today about free webhosting as well as doing a quick test for a scheduled post I’m making ahead of time.  For this site I decided to use Jekyll.  There are two reasons for this.  Firstly, open source, with our open source forward policy it just makes sense.  And second, well it’s free!  GitHub Pages is a feature of GitHub that allows you to host a page at GitHub using their domain.  You can either leave it there on their domain or redirect it a domain name that you already own like I have [here](https://technotim.live/posts/jekyll-docs-site/).  I used a guide made by Techno time which you can find here.  If you’re looking to get into some tech projects Techno Tim is one of the best out there, and I suggest you subscribe to his YouTube channel.

# Scheduled Posts

Other than showing you what I used and how to get it setup.  My other goal with this short post is to schedule it ahead of time.  Sometimes you can’t do the work you need to do at the exact time you need to do it.  So if this test works out this page should appear tomorrow.  Stay tuned.

# Update

It looks like it didn't automatically post so that will have to be looked into.
